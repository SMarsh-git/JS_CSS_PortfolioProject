                    <p>
                        Hello! I graduated from the University of York in 2019 with a degree in Poltiics with International
                        Relations. I studied all parts of politics, but I have a primary interest in political philsophy. My dissertation 
                        was a Post Structural analysis of the principles of the UK's current drug legislation and its relation to 
                        Harm Reduction policies. After graduating I worked various admin jobs, but in late 2021 I decided to pursue
                        coding and development as I have had a keen interest in computing since childhood.

                        <br /> <br />
                        I have been coding since the start of 2022. I began with Python. After my initial development I studied HTML/CSS/Javascript together
                        and have been strengthing and developing my skills in all 3 facets. I have created various webpages using all 3 in conjunction
                        and have also began to develop my react skills. Furthermore I have been honing my understanding of databases and APIs, 
                        I have used MongoDB, SQL, and REST APIs.

                    <p>
                        At the University of York I studied Politics with International Relations. I studied a huge amount of topics including; 
                        domestic politics in the UK, USA, and EU; the sphere of international politics from 1648 to present day; and historical & 
                        contemporary political philosophy. I took great interest in some modules. I enjoyed my studies in Green Politics, The History
                        of Political Thought, War and Peace, and Governmentality. <br><br> After much research and effort I completed my dissertation, titled
                        â€˜How May Principles of Harm Reduction Transform UK Drug Policy To Be More Just?', which was a post-structural analysis of the UK's current
                        drug legislation and aimed to highlight how principles of Harm Reduction policies could create legisilation which has more focus upon
                        justice and reducing drug related harms.

                    <p>
                        In early 2021 I was brought on to PMP recruitment as a Site Administrator under the Kick Start scheme. I worked onsite in a large supermarket 
                        chain's warehouse, I was placed there to help with the PMP's onsite office for their continual recruitment for the warehouse. <br><br>
                        My duties included the admin side of the recruitment aswell as some of the hands on activity. I would call all applicants as soon as they had applied
                        were I would prescreen them to ensure they were upto the sites requirements and regulations. If a candidate was suitable I would arrange for them
                        to come to the site for our weekly site tour, I would also ensure that candidates had the approriate working boots and high visibilty jackets. If they
                        did not I would arrange their provision for the site tour. After all candidates had been contacted I would repost our adverts weekly and adverts for 
                        other sites my colleagues dealt with.<br><br> Typically on a Friday I would hold the site tour; with a focus on providing as much information about 
                        the site as possible and making sure all candidates acted within health and safety regulations. After giving the site tour I would bring candidates 
                        to another area where they undertook health and safety tests, and drug and alcohol tests. I would help in the administration of drug and alcohol tests
                        and would also escort candidates who failed either test off site. After the site tour, tests, and interviews were complete I would get in contact with
                        successful candidates and invite them to our training week the week after.

                    <p>
                        I undertook a short internship with the DWP, for which I was awarded with certificates to display the skills I possessed. During
                        my internship I helped the lead at a Job Centre Plus in Runcorn. <br><br>My main duties were to keep all job displays and job listings upto date,
                        in doing this I created new adverts which were to be placed around the office and those to be put in the store front windows. Furthermore I 
                        recreated their current list of apprenticeship providers to be more concise and digestable for customers at the Job Centre. I also sat in on
                        team meetings and conference calls between all leads of Job Centres in the North West area.

                    <p>
                        While with CodeNation I have undergone two courses. The first course was a 3 week introduction to Coding. The second is my current course, which is 
                        the Master Development course. <br><br> During the introduction course I studied Python, HTML, and CSS. I created various python programs such as a 
                        prime number generator using a sieve. Also I worked in a team to create a large text based adventure game which had lots of branching paths and a 
                        combat system. In regards to HTML and CSS I created a webpage which provided documentation and examples of corrupting media for art's sake.<br><br>
                        The Master course has provided me which a much strong base to go forward with my own development. I have studied Node.JS and React, using both to create
                        programmes and webpages, for example I have made a virtual drum kit and a mock ECommerce website for Cats. Furthermore I have studied MongoDB, SQL, and APIs.
                        All these skills together have allowed for me to create great end products which I am proud of.
